    {
      question: "How do I calculate VAT from a net price?",
      answer: "To add VAT to a net price: Net Price Ã— (1 + VAT Rate Ã· 100) = Gross Price. For example, â‚¬100 net at 19% VAT = â‚¬100 Ã— 1.19 = â‚¬119 gross."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I remove VAT from a gross price?",
      answer: "To extract VAT from a gross price: Net Price = Gross Price Ã· (1 + VAT Rate Ã· 100), then VAT Amount = Gross - Net. For example, â‚¬119 gross at 19% VAT = â‚¬119 Ã· 1.19 = â‚¬100 net."
    },
    {
      question: "Which countries are supported by the calculator?",
      answer: "We support 27+ countries including all EU members (Germany, France, Finland, Spain, Italy), African countries (Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria), and Americas (Canada, Mexico, Brazil, USA)."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between net and gross prices?",
      answer: "Net price is the price before VAT is added. Gross price is the final price including VAT. Businesses often work with net prices, while consumers see gross prices."
    },
    {
      question: "Are VAT rates the same in all countries?",
      answer: "No, VAT rates vary significantly by country. For example: Germany (19%), France (20%), Finland (24%), Kenya (16%), Canada (5% GST). Many countries also have reduced rates for essential goods."
    },
    {
      question: "What are reduced VAT rates?",
      answer: "Reduced rates are lower VAT rates applied to essential goods and services like food, books, medicines, and cultural activities. For example, Germany has 7% for books and food, while France has 5.5% for food items."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate are the VAT calculations?",
      answer: "Our calculator uses precise mathematical formulas and rounds results to 2 decimal places for currency accuracy. All VAT rates are regularly updated to reflect current government regulations."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this calculator for business accounting?",
      answer: "Yes, our calculator is designed for businesses, freelancers, and accountants. However, always verify VAT rates with official tax authorities for legal compliance and consult a tax professional for complex situations."
    },
    {
      question: "What does 'zero-rated' mean?",
      answer: "Zero-rated goods and services have a 0% VAT rate. This typically applies to exports, certain food items, books, and essential services. Unlike VAT-exempt items, businesses can still recover input VAT on zero-rated supplies."
    },
    {
      question: "How often do VAT rates change?",
      answer: "VAT rates can change when governments update tax policies, usually announced in annual budgets. We monitor official sources and update our calculator whenever rates change to ensure accuracy."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I calculate VAT for multiple countries?",
      answer: "Yes! Our global calculator supports VAT calculations for countries across Europe, Africa, and Americas. Simply select the country and the appropriate VAT rate will be applied automatically."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the highest VAT rate in the world?",
      answer: "Finland currently has the highest standard VAT rate in the EU at 24%. However, some countries outside the EU have even higher rates. Our calculator includes the current rates for all supported countries."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to register for VAT in every country?",
      answer: "VAT registration requirements vary by country and your business turnover. For example, Germany requires registration above â‚¬22,000, while Finland's threshold is â‚¬15,000. Consult local tax authorities for specific requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between VAT, GST, and sales tax?",
      answer: "VAT (Value Added Tax) is used in Europe and many other countries. GST (Goods and Services Tax) is used in countries like Canada and Australia. Sales tax is used in the US. All are consumption taxes but work differently."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I save or export my VAT calculations?",
      answer: "You can copy the results using the 'Copy Results' button on any calculator page. For bulk calculations or record-keeping, consider taking screenshots or manually recording the calculations."
